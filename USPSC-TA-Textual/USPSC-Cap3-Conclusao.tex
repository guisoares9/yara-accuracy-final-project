This chapter encapsulates the culmination of the research and development efforts dedicated to the Yara system, a novel robotic platform designed to enhance the precision and safety of Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) procedures. Throughout this work, we have meticulously detailed the intricate phases involved, from the initial patient monitoring and comprehensive SEEG planning to the critical robot registration and the precise execution of the surgical operation. Furthermore, a rigorous accuracy evaluation was conducted to validate the system's efficacy and reliability. The successful integration of advanced imaging techniques, sophisticated planning tools, and a collaborative robotic arm represents a significant stride towards improving outcomes for patients with drug-resistant epilepsy, offering a more controlled and accurate approach to electrode placement.
