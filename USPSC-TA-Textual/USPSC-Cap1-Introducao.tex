\label{Introduction}

% In 1985, the first interaction between medicine and robotics occurred with the \textit{PUMA} manipulator, which was used for brain biopsies. At the end of the 20th century, there was a fundamental transformation in the methods used to perform surgical procedures. For many interventions, the invasive nature has been considerably reduced, bringing superior results such as better survival rates, lower incidence of complications, and faster recovery in terms of functional health and quality of life \cite{yoon2023robotic}.

% Surgical interventions further expanded with the introduction of the \textit{da Vinci} robot in 2000, which enabled tasks to be performed with precision and strength beyond human capability. The \textit{da Vinci} system marked a significant advancement in minimally invasive surgery (MIS) - a set of surgical techniques that minimize the size and number of incisions required, thereby reducing patient trauma, recovery time, and risk of complications \cite{morrell2021history}. The success of MIS, facilitated by robotic assistance, has driven intensive research and development of new surgical robots in recent years \cite{minimal}.

In cranial neurosurgery, intracranial electrode placement is a core procedure for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, particularly in the management of epilepsy and movement disorders. These procedures require accurate insertion of electrodes into specific brain regions and are therefore increasingly assisted by robotic systems. Among the most common applications are stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) for epilepsy diagnosis and deep brain stimulation (DBS) for treating movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease \cite{kim2021contemporaneous}.

SEEG involves the implantation of multiple depth electrodes into targeted brain areas to localize epileptogenic zones that are responsible for seizure generation. This technique provides critical information for surgical planning in drug-resistant epilepsy cases. In contrast, DBS is a therapeutic intervention where electrodes are implanted into subcortical structures, such as the subthalamic nucleus or globus pallidus, to deliver electrical stimulation that modulates abnormal neural circuits. DBS has become a standard treatment for movement disorders, notably Parkinson's disease, essential tremor, and dystonia, offering significant improvements in motor symptoms and quality of life for affected patients \cite{liu2020frameless}.

Robotic systems are increasingly adopted for intracranial electrode implantation because they provide high accuracy and improve surgical workflow. Neuromate, introduced in the late 1990s, was among the first dedicated robotic platforms for neurosurgery, enabling automated and precise placement of electrodes for procedures such as SEEG and DBS. The subsequent development of ROSA brought further advancements, expanding its applications to include spine surgery and other orthopedic interventions. In epilepsy surgery, robotic assistance has proven particularly valuable, offering accuracy in localizing and targeting epileptogenic zones comparable to traditional methods while significantly reducing operative time \cite{kaewborisutsakul2024usefulness}.

Although SEEG requires precise electrode placement, its accuracy requirements are generally less stringent than those for deep brain stimulation (DBS), which demands submillimeter precision due to the need for targeting specific anatomical nuclei. SEEG, in contrast, is hypothesis-driven and aims to sample broader brain regions based on clinical hypotheses rather than discrete anatomical targets \cite{bonda2021robot}.

SEEG represents a clinically relevant and technically feasible entry point for robotic intervention, given its procedural characteristics and the growing demand for minimally invasive, accurate, and efficient electrode implantation in epilepsy surgery. Accordingly, this work focuses on the evaluation of a collaborative robotic system designed for SEEG electrode placement called \textit{Yara}, as an initial and essential step toward advancing robotic assistance in intracranial procedures. To contextualize this objective, the following chapters review the clinical aspects of epilepsy (Sec. \ref{sec:epi}), the classification and impact of seizure types, and the current therapeutic strategies available (Sec. \ref{sec:methods}).

\chapter[Objectives]{Objectives}
\label{Objectives}

The primary objective of this work is to evaluate the accuracy of the Yara collaborative robotic platform for intracranial electrode placement during SEEG (stereoelectroencephalography) procedures. This evaluation is performed using anatomical phantoms that closely mimic human cranial structures to measure electrode placement accuracy. By focusing on phantom-based experiments, the study aims to establish a baseline for the system’s technical performance in a controlled environment prior to any clinical application.

A key objective is the design and fabrication of cranial phantoms specifically for SEEG accuracy validation. These phantoms are developed to replicate the anatomical and mechanical properties of the human skull and brain, allowing for reproducible assessment of electrode placement. The creation of these phantoms is essential to ensure that the experimental conditions closely simulate those encountered in actual surgical scenarios.

Finally, the study aims to conduct accuracy validation tests using the Yara robotic platform, both in the laboratory and in the operating room environment. By performing electrode placement trials in these settings, the work seeks to assess the system’s performance under different conditions, identify potential sources of error, and provide quantitative data on placement accuracy.

\section{Epilepsy}\label{sec:epi}

% @gui one for what is epilepsy
%...
Epilepsy is a chronic brain disease characterized by a long-lasting predisposition to generate seizures, not caused by any immediate insult to the central nervous system, and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of recurrent seizures \cite{beghi2020epidemiology}. It is the most common neurological diseases worldwide, affecting different social classes, ages, and geographic locations \cite{ngugi2010estimation}.

The definition of an epileptic seizure is a repeated and transient episode that manifests through patterned behaviors and reflects underlying neural processes associated with the condition \cite{fisher2005epileptic}. Although all people with epilepsy experience seizures, not all individuals with seizures have epilepsy. Epileptic seizures can also occur after an acute injury to the central nervous system (CNS) of structural, systemic, toxic, or metabolic origin; these events are considered acute manifestations of the insult and may not recur once the underlying cause has been removed or the acute phase has passed \cite{beghi2010recommendation}.

% types of epilepsy seizures
Epileptic seizures are categorized according to three main characteristics: origin in the brain, state of consciousness during the seizure, and level of body movement. Seizures can be classified as focal or generalized based on the first characteristic. The second characteristic considers whether consciousness is intact or impaired during the seizure, while the third characteristic refers to body movement, which may present motor or non-motor reactions \cite{beghi2020epidemiology}.

Motor seizures encompass a variety of distinct manifestations. Atonic crises are characterized by a sudden and temporary loss of muscle tone, resulting in a sudden fall of the individual. On the other hand, tonic crises involve a sudden and prolonged increase in muscle tone, leading to intense stiffness. Clonic seizures are marked by rhythmic and repetitive muscle contractions, which can affect different parts of the body, while myoclonic seizures are characterized by rapid and sudden muscle contractions that can involve a specific muscle group or the entire body. Epileptic spasms, automatisms, and hyperkinetic seizures are also categorized \cite{sarmast2020current}.

On the other hand, non-motor crises can present different forms of manifestation. They can be autonomic, involving dysfunctions in the autonomic nervous system, such as changes in blood pressure or heart rate. In addition, there may be crises of behavioral arrest, during which the individual may appear paralyzed or unable to perform voluntary movements. Cognitive crises affect cognitive function and may include memory lapses or mental confusion. Emotional crises are related to changes in the emotional state, such as feelings of fear, anxiety, or euphoria. Finally, sensory crises affect the senses and can cause abnormal sensations, such as visual or auditory hallucinations \cite{sarmast2020current}.

\section{Treatment Methods} \label{sec:methods}

% @gui one for what are the treatments
%...
Epilepsy affects an estimated 70 million people worldwide; about 40\% of these patients experience drug-resistant seizures. In such cases, surgery may be considered as a therapeutic option. This procedure is indicated for patients with disabling focal epilepsy who are unresponsive to drug treatment and whose seizures originate in a specific region of the brain that can be removed with minimal risk of neurological or cognitive dysfunction \cite{miller2013surgical}. Surgery can significantly improve quality of life by providing better seizure control and reducing dependence on high-cost or potentially harmful antiepileptic medications.

Correctly locating the seizure focus is crucial when preparing for surgery in patients with epilepsy \cite{miller2013surgical}. Localization methods aim to determine the focal region accurately, minimizing surgical invasiveness while seeking complete removal of the epileptogenic zone.

This is especially important, as the removal of critical areas of the brain can result in functional deficits, such as impairment of speech, memory, motor coordination, among other functions, depending on the location of the focus. Therefore, ensuring accurate location of the focus is essential to guarantee good surgical results and minimize potential adverse effects.

\subsection{Video-EEG} \label{sec:non-invasive-eeg}

% @gui EEG
%...
Before progressing to invasive procedures, a non-invasive analysis is typically performed to identify potential areas of seizure foci and to guide further investigation. Scalp EEG is the primary non-invasive technique used for this purpose. Electrodes are placed on the patient's scalp using a cap or similar device, enabling monitoring during interictal (between seizures), ictal (during seizures), and post-ictal (after seizures) periods. This superficial electrode arrangement measures electrical potentials generated by neuronal activity near the skull. Standard systems use 32, 64, or 96 electrodes distributed across the scalp, with higher-density arrays (up to 256 channels) available for more detailed studies \cite{Sun2023}. Scalp EEG is essential for initial diagnosis and localization of seizure activity, providing critical information before invasive methods are considered \cite{miller2013surgical}.

\subsection{Invasive EEG: Subdural EEG (SDE) and Stereoencephalography (SEEG)}

%@gui subdural EEG
%...
Subdural EEG (SDE), also known as electrocorticography (ECoG), was developed to provide more precise measurement of brain activity than scalp EEG. In SDE, an electrode array is placed directly on the surface of the cortex after a portion of the skull is removed, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:eeg-ecog-seeg}. This direct contact enables the acquisition of signals with higher fidelity and less noise compared to scalp EEG \cite{lesser2010subdural}. The electrodes typically remain in place for several days to record both ictal and interictal activity. However, SDE is highly invasive, requiring two craniotomies, one for electrode placement and another for removal, and carries a significant risk of postoperative infection, often related to surgical contamination. These drawbacks have motivated the development of alternative methods, such as SEEG, which aim to reduce invasiveness and associated complications \cite{jehi2021comparative}.

% @gui SEEG
%...
In France, in the 1950s, Jean Talairach and Jean Bancaud developed a method that monitors deep parts of the cortex through insertion of depth electrodes, seeking to replace SDE \cite{mazoyer2008memoriam}. This method was called Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) and today it is one of the most adopted invasive methods for locating the focal zone of seizures. SEEG does not present many of the problems associated with SDE. In this method, cylindrical electrodes (more like small wires) are introduced through small holes in the skull, without the need for craniotomy. SEEG has lower rates of infection, hemorrhage, neurological deficits, and morbidity compared to SDE, in addition to being a faster procedure, allowing the analysis of deeper brain tissues and having shown greater effectiveness in localizing and controlling seizures after surgical treatment \cite{fiani2021stereoelectroencephalography}. Fig. \ref{fig:eeg-ecog-seeg} illustrates the positioning of electrodes in scalp EEG, Subdural EEG (electrocorticography), and SEEG.

\end{figure}

% Metrics for analyzing the accuracy
%...euclidean distance and etc
Electrodes implanted during SEEG are used to properly identify the epileptogenic zone (EZ) \cite{Jones2018}. Planning prior to surgery is carried out to define the number of electrodes, the position of the entry points, and the target point of each electrode. Metrics are defined for evaluating the position of the SEEG implants. Entry points are defined as the point at which the electrode initiates contact with the surface of the brain or the skull. Target points are defined as the final position of the electrode, usually in a region within the brain.

Widely adopted metrics for evaluating the accuracy of the electrode placement are the Euclidean distance between the planned entry points and the post-surgical entry points, and the distance between the planned target points and the post-surgical target points.

\subsection{Stereotaxy}

SEEG operation techniques began in the 1950s with Jean Talairach and Jean Bancaud, who developed x‑ray–based methods for planning and verifying electrode positioning. Since then the development of mechanical  stereotactic apparatus to fix the skull and guide electrode placement concentrated in the mid‑20th century (late 1940s–1950s). The early Talairach apparatus featured skull‑fixation pins, a support for the x‑ray tube, and radiographic film \cite{mazoyer2008memoriam}. Contemporary popular frames, such as the Leksell frame developed in Sweden around the same period, trace their origins to these innovations.

With the advent of computed tomography, surgeries began to be planned based on slices, allowing a three-dimensional understanding of the areas of investigation. Devices that use the three-dimensionality of tomography images were adapted, adding a support with a diagonal cut in the shape of an N, allowing the calculation of the height of each tomography slice in relation to the device coordinates. This system became known as the N-Localizer and is widely used in current neurosurgeries \cite{lozano2009textbook}.

     \label{fig:tailarach-frame}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frame-based Surgeries} \label{sec:stereotactics}

The earliest SEEG technique involved introducing electrodes in parallel trajectories, normal to the sagittal view, using the Cartesian map called Talairach coordinates \cite{mazoyer2008memoriam}. Subsequently, variations of the technique were explored with the introduction of  stereotactic arcs that can be fixed to devices such as the Leksell or CRW and that allow the introduction of oblique electrodes. Therefore, the assessment of the impact on precision between different techniques for implanting oblique or orthogonal electrodes was studied in \cite{Iordanou2019}. Figure \ref{fig:leksell} presents the Leksell G apparatus and the N-Localizer.

Originally, the calculation of the coordinates of each electrode in relation to the apparatus was carried out manually, using the N-Localizer geometry. Some surgical planning software automated the calculation of entry and target coordinates using image-processing methods that detect the N-Localizer \cite{dasgupta2022previous}. These programs also feature planning tools such as fusion of CT and MRI images.

     \caption{Frame Leksell G without N-Localizer and with N-Localizer respectively \cite{rojas2016eval}.}
     \label{fig:leksell}
\end{figure}

Image fusion allows precise surgical planning by combining preoperative MRI to assess vascular structures and functional anatomy near electrode trajectories and intraoperative CT to permit frame positioning. During surgery, a stereotactic frame and N-Localizer are attached to the patient's head, followed by an intraoperative CT scan. This scan is fused with the preoperative MRI, enabling the planning software to identify N-Localizer fiducials and accurately compute coordinates for electrode placement. These coordinates are then inputted into the stereotactic frame or arc, guiding the surgeon in positioning each electrode along the planned trajectory.

%In this regard, Medtronic, with the Stealth Autoguide \cite{medtronic}, developed a system that allows the tool to be fixed, facilitating the drilling of the skull and the fixation of the guide screw.

Surgeries based on stereotactic devices have a broad history of use, but they also have disadvantages relative to more recent systems, such as robotic platforms. Among the disadvantages, stereotactic frame-based procedures require placement of the apparatus at the beginning of surgery, followed by an intraoperative CT generally performed in another room, and the fusion of this CT with the MRI used for planning. This intraoperative CT is not necessary with frameless robotic systems.

\end{table}

The Table \ref{tab:frame-vs-frameless} presents a comparison between the procedures necessary to perform frame-based surgery compared to frameless surgeries. The greater number of steps during surgery increases the time needed to perform the surgery and may result in loss of accuracy due to non-deterministic procedures and possible human errors.

Performing a CT scan during surgery is time-consuming. The frame-based process requires a tomography with the stereotactic device immediately after its placement. While having a CT scanner available in the same operating room would streamline logistics, this setup is rarely feasible, as most hospitals do not have a dedicated CT scanner for each operating room. Although some facilities offer operating rooms equipped with CT scanners, their limited availability and competition with other ongoing surgeries complicate scheduling and scalability. As a result, the typical solution is to transport the sedated patient to a separate CT scanner, which increases surgery time and possibly introduces additional risks.

Another significant source of error arises from the fusion of intraoperative CT images acquired with the stereotactic device and preoperative MRI images. Image fusion involves the precise alignment of two volumetric datasets - typically, the CT and MRI scans - so that both accurately represent the same anatomical structures. This process is necessary because the spatial orientation and coordinate systems of the CT and MRI volumes differ in space due to variations in patient positioning and scanner-specific parameters. Imperfect alignment during fusion can introduce discrepancies in the localization of entry and target points, thereby contributing to the overall error in electrode placement.

The alignment of the preoperative MRI with the intraoperative CT, in the case of SEEG surgery, allows the planning performed on the MRI to be accurately transferred to the CT acquired with the  stereotactic apparatus. In this way, the result of the fusion is the planning of the surgery, containing entry and target points in the same reference as the apparatus images, thus allowing the calculation of the coordinates necessary to align the ruler or  stereotactic arc in each trajectory. Even in the most ideal case, this process is not perfect and will contribute to the final error of each trajectory.

In summary, the introduction of frame-based stereotactic techniques advanced numerous procedures and contributed to the development of novel surgical methods, establishing them for many years as the gold standard. Nevertheless, the operational workflow required by frame-based systems presents several disadvantages. Frame fixation, patient transport to the CT, and the image-fusion process increase operative time and procedural complexity, and may contribute to the cumulative error affecting each trajectory in SEEG.

\subsection{Robot-based Surgeries}

\begin{figure}
     \centering
     \includegraphics[width=0.99\textwidth]{USPSC-img/robots_enhanced.png}
     \caption{Robots capable of performing SEEG surgeries: Zimmer Biomet ROSA ONE Brain, Brainlab Cirq and Renishaw Neuromate respectively.}
     \label{fig:robots}
\end{figure}

The frame limitations motivated the development and adoption of frameless robotic systems for SEEG surgeries. Neuromate, introduced in the late 1990s, was among the first commercially available robots for SEEG neurosurgery \cite{cardinale2013stereoelectroencephalography}. Subsequently, Medtech (acquired by Zimmer Biomet) developed ROSA ONE Brain in 2007, and Brainlab introduced Cirq, both capable of performing SEEG procedures. These systems also support other neurosurgical interventions, including brain biopsies and DBS. Figure \ref{fig:robots} shows Neuromate system, which features a triangular base fixed to the floor and supports for skull fixation using Mayfield or Leksell frames.

A large series reporting on a total of 500 procedures established the safety and accuracy of Stereoelectroencephalography (SEEG) methodology, confirming a low major complication rate of 2.4\%, and demonstrating a median target point localization error of 1.77 mm for the modern robot-assisted workflow \cite{cardinale2013stereoelectroencephalography}. Building on this foundation, subsequent prospective series, such as one of 100 patients (101 procedures, 1245 electrodes), demonstrated that robot-assisted SEEG is safe, accurate (median EPE 1.2 mm, TPE 1.7 mm), and efficient (planning ~30 min, operative ~130 min), yielding seizure freedom in 66\% of resected patients with a 4\% complication rate, and showing comparable accuracy with shorter operative times than traditional frame-based methods \cite{gonzalez2016technique}.


% neuromate
Current robotic SEEG systems, while beneficial, have room for significant improvement. Some reports show that adoption of the Neuromate platform has been constrained by limitations in allowable patient positioning, which restrict its compatibility with some intraoperative workflows \cite{kajita2015installation}. In addition, the system's limited portability requires allocation of a dedicated operating room, creating a logistical barrier to clinical deployment. The robot is a 5‑DOF manipulator, presenting reduced range of possible end-effector (EF) poses compared with conventional 6‑DOF robots, thereby limiting trajectory flexibility for certain electrode insertions.

% cirq
% The Cirq robotic system is used with a full neuronavigation system. A device with reflective spheres is fixed to the robot's flange. This device is viewed by an infrared stereo camera and the position of the tool is calculated. Its adjustment is done semi-automatically, where the surgeon approaches the robot to the desired position and the robot adjusts itself with an actuator fixed to its flange. The neuronavigator is used to operate this system, which has: a camera carriage; a screen carriage; and a robotic manipulator fixed to the operating table. Combined with other devices present in the operating room, these three devices bring difficulties in logistics and in organizing the space in the room compared to systems that have only one carriage.

ROSA lacks many collaborative-arm features. Although designed to work alongside the surgeon, it does not include sensors common to collaborative systems, such as joint-torque sensing and automatic collision detection and braking. For this reason, ROSA operates as a conventional robot in collaborative tasks, placing the surgeon and patient at higher risk than with true collaborative systems. Yara, the system proposed in this project, uses collaborative robots designed for shared operation with humans, enhancing the safety of both surgeon and patient.

% Typically, non-collaborative industrial robots are required to operate at a safe distance from humans according to workplace safety regulations, but surgical robots are not subject to these industrial standards. Current commercial neurosurgical systems do not incorporate collaborative robotics technology. Collaborative systems enhance safety during robotic manipulation in surgery, offering advantages over existing non-collaborative platforms.

% The Stealth AutoGuide by Medtronic \cite{medtronic} is a compact robotic system that attaches directly to the Mayfield head clamp, rather than functioning as a full robotic arm. It assists the surgeon by aligning the trajectory of each electrode during SEEG procedures. The system operates in conjunction with their neuronavigation platform, which is widely used for image-guided surgery. Neuronavigation systems typically employ either optical (stereo camera) or electromagnetic tracking to display instrument positions relative to the patient's anatomy, using preoperative CT or MRI data to guide access to specific brain targets. By integrating with these systems, the small robot arm improves the accuracy of electrode placement, providing precise guidance along planned trajectories.


This project presents the accuracy of Yara, a collaborative robotic platform developed for frameless intracranial electrode placement procedures, designed to offer accuracy, reduced surgical time, and enhanced safety compared to traditional frame-based methods. The system integrates planning software for defining electrode entry and target points, MRI/CT image fusion, automated patient registration using depth cameras, and collision-free robotic positioning. In this work, we present a comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy of the Yara platform for SEEG electrode placement, based on phantom experiments that simulate clinical conditions.
